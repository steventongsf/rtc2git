# rtc2git

This is my modifications of a tool made for migrating code and code-history from an existing [RTC](https://jazz.net/products/rational-team-concert/) SCM repository into a Git repository
It uses the CLI of RTC to gather the required informations.

## Prerequirements

- RTC Server with Version 5.0+ (was tested using 5.0.1)
- **[SCM Tools](https://jazz.net/downloads/rational-team-concert/releases/5.0.1?p=allDownloads)** from IBM.  
   To avoid an account creation on the jazz.net site, you could use [bugmenot](http://bugmenot.com/).  
   Please make sure that your SCM Tools run in **English** (because we need to parse their output sometimes).  
   There is a wiki page on how to [configure RTC CLI](https://github.com/rtcTo/rtc2git/wiki/configure-RTC-CLI))
- Python 3.4+ (does not work with previous versions or with Python 2)

## Development-Status
For migrating bigger repositories (> 10000 changes) I advise you to use our other tool [rtc2gitcli](https://github.com/rtcTo/rtc2gitcli) as the IBM Java API is more stable than IBM CLI API. 
However, this project is easier to run and adapt to different environments.

This project is no longer in active development, because the author has no access to any RTC Server anymore (since they are migrated to git) and changes to code can only be hardly tested.

## Usage

- Create a config file called `config.ini` and fill out the needed information, use the supplied `config.ini.sample` or `config.ini.minimum.sample` as reference
- Execute `migration.py`


### Pitfalls
- Your stream or workspace is not allowed to have spaces in their name. In the case where names contain spaces, please clone and rename them and use the cloned workspace/stream for migration (see [#104](https://github.com/rtcTo/rtc2git/issues/104), [#51](https://github.com/rtcTo/rtc2git/issues/51)).
- Sometimes rtc2git can not determine any baseline and won't find any changes (accepting changesets 0) - Please refer to how to reset your workspace to an older state explained [here](https://github.com/rtcTo/rtc2git/wiki/Resetting-your-workspace-to-an-older-state)
- The provided result of the compare command of IBM RTC CLI API does sometimes not provide the changesets in the fully correct order. This can result in merge conflicts, which should be solved by loading the workspace into eclipse, manually resolving them and resuming the migration by running the rtc2git again.

## How does it work?

1. It initalizes an empty git repository and clones it
2. In this repository, it loads a newly created (which will be set to the oldest baseline possible) or existing rtc workspace
3. The baseline of each component of a given stream is determined
4. For each baseline a compare command will be executed
5. The result of the compare will be parsed to get to the necessary commit-information (such as author, comment, date)
6. The change will be accepted in the workspace
7. The corresponding git command will be executed to do the same change in the git-repository
